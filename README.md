# real-time-graph-generation-using-python
Hi guys this is jaswanth tanukonda
this program is about generating a real time pie or bar chart 
only if you want barchart you need to do:
1. in the pets.txt file, in the top include
    barchart 1
2. if you want piechart just enter the data as usual
 note:
 after the data is entered make you you leave 1 line space for barchart and 2 line spaces for piechart in the .txt file
 
 
 fin :)
